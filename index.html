                <h4>Web Development</h4>
                <p>As a web developer, I possess a deep understanding of front-end and back-end web development technologies and tools. I am skilled in using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces, along with frameworks like React or Vue.js for front-end development. 
                   On the back-end, I have experience with Node.js, PHP, or Python to handle server-side logic, manage databases with SQL or NoSQL, and ensure smooth integration with the front end. I am familiar with tools like Git for version control and team collaboration, as well as development methodologies like Agile to effectively manage projects.

                <h4>Quality Assurance</h4>
                <p>In Quality Assurance, I have the skills to ensure that each product developed meets high-quality standards. I am experienced in manual testing and automated testing using tools such as Selenium, JUnit, or TestNG, with comprehensive knowledge of functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing. 
                   I can create and execute test cases to detect and report bugs or deficiencies and work closely with developers to resolve issues and optimize product quality. I understand the critical role of QA in the software development lifecycle to deliver a consistent and error-free user experience.
